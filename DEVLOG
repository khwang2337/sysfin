    Proposal 
        Kevin & Ricky - Argued about battle mechanics, chat system, graphical utility; came up with early designs (double terminals, etc.)
        Ruochong - Looked at text based rpg examples such as Zork. 
        Matthew - compiled a list of data structures and what topics we learned in class to be implemented in the project.

    Skeletal Frame
        Kevin - Planned function frames for chat-system and helped with structs
        Ricky - Wrote up a giant combat.txt file that outlines the combat
        Ruochong - Planned networking skeleton
        Ricky+Matthew - Talked about combat->stats with skill trees and struct of character with stats.

    Login/Register System
        Kevin - Built off skeletal frame, Files save information, Check-while loops
