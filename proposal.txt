PROPOSAL

RPG

Elements of the project:

-A terminal session where a player can chat with other party members or input commands
    a)The program will recognize a command by checking if there is a special character in the first index of the input (such as a colon)
    b)Inputs without special characters will print as a normal message
        Example:
        Ricky types "heal me"
        Kevin types "no"
        Kevin types ":use 1 on matthew"
        Ricky types "i hate you"
        
        Display:
        [Ricky]heal me
        [Kevin]no
        Kevin used move 1(Heal) on Matthew!
        [Ricky]i hate you
        
-A terminal session that displays sprites, player statistics, and move choices
    a)Will be linked to the chat terminal through PIPES
    b)Utilizes a HANDSHAKE to make sure the two terminals are connected
    c)Makes decisions based on the output recieved from the chat terminal
    
-Party members will be linked through NETWORKING
    a)every player's display terminal will update every time a move is made

-GUI is comprised of two windows, one will be the aforementioned terminal and the
other will be a terminal or a sdl window used purely as a graphical utility.
