NETWORKED-RPG
A text based Role Playing Game with a networked multiplayer system that connects 4 players together to engage in cooperative gameplay against computer controlled obstacles


USER INTERFACE
All user interaction is performed through terminal windows, no GUI planned.
Two main elements of the user experience
-A terminal session where a player can chat with other party members or input commands
    a)The program will recognize a command by checking if there is a special character in the first index of the input (such as a colon)
    b)Inputs without special characters will print as a normal message
        Example:
        Ricky types "heal me"
        Kevin types "no"
        Kevin types "/use 1 2"
        Ricky types "i hate you"

        Display:
        [Ricky] heal me
        [Kevin] no
        <Kevin> used Heal on <Matthew>!
        [Ricky] i hate you

-A terminal session that displays sprites, player statistics, and move choices
    a)Will be linked to the chat terminal through PIPES
    b)Utilizes a HANDSHAKE to make sure the two terminals are connected
    c)Makes decisions based on the output received from the chat terminal


TECHNICAL DESIGN
Class topics used:
-Process interaction: To setup the processes when starting the game
-Pipes: To connect the input and display terminal sessions
-Networking: To communicate game information between each player
-Handshake: Establishing/Verifying connections between two terminal sessions and network connection between players
-String parsing: To parse input commands in input window
-File IO: Savefile write/read

MECHANICS MECHANICS PLANNED
    -Party System
        -Players can form parties in the lobby
        -Party leader has the party powers: kick, delegate, etc.

    -Ready System
        -The party leader can enter the dungeon after all the players are ready

    -Friend System(perhaps)

    -Dungeon-based Experience
        -dungeons will be replayable
        -the player must beat the lower-difficulty dungeons to access more difficult ones

    -Progression
        -Players will get stronger through their SKILLS
        -There are no LEVELS or STATS
        -We may take this in two different directions
            -Mastery System in which players can use and switch between any skills (in Lobby)
            -Path System in which players choose to upgrade their skills at junctions (loses other option)
